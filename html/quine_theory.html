                        The Quine-McCluskey technique developed Edward J. McCluskey and Willard V. Quine is yet another method of simplifying Boolean functions. However, this method is better preferred than the Karnaugh Map Method as it is much easier to simplify Boolean functions which have more than 5 variables.<p></p>This method utilizes a tabular method using prime implicants, where a prime implicant is a product or sum term which cannot be reduced any further even by combining any other product or sum terms from the Boolean function.
