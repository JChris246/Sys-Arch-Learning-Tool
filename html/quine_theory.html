                        <h2 class="red">What is The Quine-McCluskey Technique?</h2><br class="space"/>
                        The Quine-McCluskey technique developed Edward J. McCluskey and Willard V. Quine is yet another method of simplifying Boolean functions. However, this method is better preferred than the Karnaugh Map Method as it is much easier to simplify Boolean functions which have more than 5 variables.<p></p>This method utilizes a tabular method using prime implicants, where a prime implicant is a product or sum term which cannot be reduced any further even by combining any other product or sum terms from the Boolean function.
                    </div>
                    <div class="center">
                        <h2 class="green">Example 1</h2><br class="space"/>
                        <b>F(W,X,Y,Z) = &#931;m (2,6,8,9,10,11,14,15)</b><p></p>
                        First of all, you set out the numbers in their binary format as well as the letter format where 0 represents a complemented term or ( ‘ ) above that letter and 1 would be an uncomplemented term.<br class="space"/>
                        <table class="invisible"><tr><td>2</td><td>0010</td><td>W'X'YZ'</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>0110</td><td>W'XYZ'</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>1000</td><td>WX'Y'Z'</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>1001</td><td>WX'Y'Z</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>1010</td><td>WX'YZ'</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>1110</td><td>WXYZ'</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>1110</td><td>WXYZ'</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>1111</td><td>WXYZ</td></tr></table><p></p>
						Next you set out a table with 6 rows with the first column being the letter configurations, 2nd the index or the number represented by the letter configuration and the other 4 are the separate letters.<p></p>Also, you will group the numbers based on how many 1s are contained in it. For example, the <span class="red">red</span> group is the number with only 1 one, the <span class="yellow">yellow</span> represents numbers with 2 ones, <span class="blue">blue</span> represents numbers with 3 ones and <span class="green">green</span> represents numbers with 4 ones.<p></p>
						<i>1<sup>st</sup> table</sup></i><table class="invisible white space">
							<!--fairly lazy dont judge me--><style>td {padding: 6px;} </style>
							<tr class="purplebg"><td></td><td class="bold">Index</td><td class="bold">W</td><td class="bold">Y</td><td class="bold">X</td><td class="bold">Z</td></tr>
							<tr class="redbg"><td>W'X'YZ'</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="redbg"><td>WX'Y'Z'</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
							<tr class="yellowbg"><td>W'XYZ'</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>WX'Y'Z</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
							<tr class="yellowbg"><td>WX'YZ'</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr class="bluebg"><td >WX'YZ'</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>

						</table><p></p>
						Next you will compare numbers in group <span class="red">Red</span> or group <span class="red">1</span> with those in Group <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> or Group <span class="yellow">2</span>. You will look for the numbers where there is only one bit different when comparing. That different bit would be omitted and the remaining would be the result.<p></p>
						For example, with W'X'YZ' (0010) in the <span class="red">Red</span> Group that would compare with W'XYZ'- 0110 in the <span class="yellow">2<sup>nd</sup></span> group and as they have only one bit different which is the X and X' that would be omitted, and it would leave W'YZ'.<p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Matches for 1st table</b><br class="space"/><span class="red">Red</span> and <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> Groups - (2,6) W'YZ'; (2,10) X'YZ'; (8,9) WX'Y'; (8,10) WX'Z'<br/><span class="yellow">Yellow</span> and <span class="blue">Blue</span> Groups - (6,14) XYZ'; (9,11) WX'Z; (10,11) WX'Y; (10,14) WYZ'<br/><span class="blue">Blue</span> and <span class="green">Green</span> Groups - (11,15) WYZ; (14,15) WXY<br class="space"/><p></p>

						</table><p></p><i>N.B. the tick or &#10003; represents which row was matched to something, thus an X would represent that a row was not matched to anything and thus, would be automatically added to the result.</i><p></p>

						Here you would do the same as you did for the 1<sup>st</sup> table where you compare elements in the 1<sup>st</sup> group or <span class="red">Red</span> group with those in the <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> group or 2nd group, then the <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> group with the <span class="blue">Blue</span> Group.<p></p>For example, In the <span class="red">first</span> group there is W'YZ' and the <span class="yellow">second</span> group there is WYZ' therefore there is 1 bit/letter different, which would be the W, thus you omit that W and result in YZ'.<p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Matches for 2nd Table</b><br class="space"/>
						<span class="red">Red</span> and <span class="yellow">Yellow</span> Group - (2,6,10,14) YZ'; (2,10,6,14) YZ'; (8,9, 10, 11) WX'; (8,10, 9,11) WX'.<br><span class="yellow">Yellow</span> and <span class="blue">Blue</span> Group - (10,14, 11,15) WY; (10,11, 14,15) WY.<p></p>
						<i>N.B if there are two of the same terms for matches in the 2nd group for example YZ' and YZ' you just use one thus only, YZ'.</i><p></p>
						So, based on the matches for the 2nd table so far, we have <b>YZ' + WX' + WY</b><p></p>

						So, for the third table, where ever you see any of the elements in the first column in any of the letter configurations in the first row you would place an X.<p></p>For example, for YZ' you can find that in WXYZ', WX'YZ', W'XYZ' and W'X'YZ'.<p></p>An X - would represent the first found match.<p></p>A &#9633; – would represent if you find a match in a column which already has an X, you would use the &#9633; instead of putting another X in the column.<p></p>A &#9679; – would represent if there is no other matches found in the column but one, then put a &#9679;.<p></p>
						<i>3<sup>rd</sup> table</sup></i><table class="invisible white">
							<tr class="purplebg"><td></td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td><td>WXYZ</td></tr><tr class="orangebg"><td>YZ'</td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td>&#9679;</td><td>&#9679;</td></tr>
							<tr class="orangebg"><td>WX'</td><td></td><td></td><td>X</td><td>&#9633;</td><td>&#9679;</td><td>&#9679;</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr class="orangebg"><td>WY</td><td>&#9679;</td><td>&#9633;</td><td>&#9633;</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
						</table><p></p>

						So, since there is a &#9633; in all of the rows of YZ', WX' and WY then the final function is: <b>YZ' + WX' + WY</b>.<p></p><i>N.B It may seem that the third table would be useless however in <a href="quine_examples.html" class="novisit">further examples</a>, you would see that the third table is used for further minimization of the Boolean Function.</i>

						<b>Step 1</b><p></p>For the first step the terms are arranged in the table from the term with the most compliments to the term with the least compliments. The binary equivalent of the terms are then represented in the respective A,B,C and D columns (A 1 for an uncomplimented term and a 0 for a complimented term). The index column is then used to store the decimal equivalent of the binary term.<p></p>
						After this is done, starting from the top you check the terms binary form and look for a <i>SINGLE variable</i> change. If this change is found, you then place a tick in the furthest column showing that the element was matched to another.<p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Step 2</b><p></p>In this step, you will now combine the terms that matched with one another for each instance leaving out the term that is different.<p></p>A'B'C'D + A'BC'D = A'C'D<br/>A'BC'D + A'BCD = ABD<br/>A'BC'D + ABC'D = BC'D<br/>A'BCD' + A'BCD = A'BC<br/>ABC'D' + ABC'D = ABC'<br/>A'BCD + ABCD = BCD<br/>AB'CD + ABCD = ACD<br/>ABC'D + ABCD = ABD<p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Step 3</b><p></p>In this step, you will now repeat the process done in <b>Step 1</b>. However, this time with a few changes, you will now use the terms found in <b>Step 2</b> as your product terms. In addition, we will now be placing a  "-" in the Index column and in the column of the missing variable of the term. This is shown below.<p></p><i>**Do not forget the comparing step**</i><p></p>You will realize that some of the terms will not match with anything and that is okay, do not panic. The terms that do not match with anything place an "X" rather than your usual tick. We will revisit this later.<p></p>
						<table class="invisible white"><tr class="bluebg"><td>Product term</td><td>Index</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td></td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>A'C'D</td><td>-</td><td>0</td><td>-</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>X</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>A'BD</td><td>-</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>&#10003;</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>BC'D'</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>&#10003;</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>A'BC</td><td>-</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>X</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>ABC'</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>-</td><td>X</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>BCD</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>&#10003;</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>ACD</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>X</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>ABD</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>&#10003;</td></tr></table><p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Step 4</b><p></p>At this step we will repeat the process used in <b>Step 2</b>.<p></p>A'BD + ABD = BD<br/>BC'D + BCD = BD<p></p><i>N.B When you get two terms that are the same when placing them into the table you only place it once.</i><p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Step 5</b><p></p><b>Step 1</b> is repeated again as we still have a term. <b>Step 1</b> is always repeated until there are no longer any terms to place into a new table.<p></p>
						<table class="white invisible"><tr class="bluebg"><td >Product Term</td><td>Index</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td></td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>BD</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>X</td></tr></table><p></p><br class="space"/>
						Seeing as <b>BD</b> is in the table by itself, it can clearly not match with any other elements. Therefore, this is our last time repeating <b>Step 1</b>. Once you reach this point you can move on to the final step.<p></p><br class="space"/>
						<b>Step 5</b><p></p><table class="invisible white"><tr class="bluebg"><td></td><td>ABCD</td><td>ABC'D</td><td>ABC'D'</td><td>AB'CD</td><td>A'BCD</td><td>A'BCD'</td><td>A'BC'D</td><td>A'B'C'D</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>BD</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td><td>X</td><td></td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>A'C'D</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&#9633;</td><td>&#9679;</td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>A'BC</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>&#9633;</td><td>&#9679;</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>ABC'</td><td></td><td>&#9633;</td><td>&#9679;</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr class="yellowbg"><td>ACD</td><td>&#9633;</td><td></td><td></td><td>&#9679;</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table><p></p><br class="space"/>
						Now that we have reached the final step, let's explain what happens here. The column headings are each of the individual terms from the original expression, the row headings are the terms which we marked with a “X” during our work with the other tables. Now, an X is placed wherever the row element is apart of the column element. Afterwards, whenever an X is in a column by itself changed to a circle. Also, whenever an X is in the same row as circle, that X is changed to a square. Finally, your simplified expression will consist of a function made up of the terms represented by the Circled Terms.<p></p>This being said, the final answer is :<b>A'BC + ACD + A'BC + A'C'D</b><p></p>
