				<h1 class="blue">Boolean Laws</h1>
				<p>Boolean laws are a set of rules or Laws of Boolean Algebra expressions have been invented to help reduce the number of logic gates needed to perform a particular logic operation resulting in a list of functions or theorems known commonly as the Laws of Boolean Algebra.</p>
				<p>Boolean Algebra is the mathematics we use to analyse digital gates and circuits. We can use these “Laws of Boolean” to both reduce and simplify a complex Boolean expression in an attempt to reduce the number of logic gates required. Boolean Algebra is therefore a system of mathematics based on logic that has its own set of rules or laws which are used to define and reduce Boolean expressions.</p>
				<p>The variables used in Boolean Algebra only have one of two possible values, a logic “0” and a logic “1” but an expression can have an infinite number of variables all labelled individually to represent inputs to the expression, For example, variables A, B, C etc, giving us a logical expression of A + B = C, but each variable can ONLY be a 0 or a 1.</p>
				<p>Examples of these individual laws of Boolean, rules and theorems for Boolean Algebra are given in the following table.</p>
